# OGS Kbd Nav

Keyboard &mdash; better &mdash; navigation for [OGS][ogs], the best online platform for playing the game of [Go][go].

Two other examples of keyboard navigation browser extensions:

- [Web Search Navigator][web_search_navigator]: probably one of the best productivity browser extensions out there.
- [YouTube Kbd Nav][youtube_kbd_nav]: a way of making YouTube 95% &mdash; of the time &mdash; navigable through the keyboard<sup>1</sup>.
